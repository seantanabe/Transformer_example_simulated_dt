### Predicting Simulated Neural Activity Using Transformer Models

Example application of transformer model on prediction of simulated timeseries data. The simulated data mimics the structure of neural activity for a task with onset. Dimensions include neurons, trials, and time units, with response curves occurring around t = 0ms, reflecting a timing preference relative to the task.
